### Project Explanation: Mini-Framework and TodoMVC

This project involves creating a custom JavaScript framework from scratch, without relying on existing frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. The framework must include four core features: **DOM Abstraction**, **Routing System**, **State Management**, and **Event Handling**. Additionally, you’ll use this framework to build a **TodoMVC** application, a standard todo list app with specific functionality (e.g., adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks). Comprehensive **documentation** is required to ensure users can understand and use the framework easily. The framework and TodoMVC app must be structured in a folder that allows the app to run from the root directory.

The framework inverts control (unlike a library), meaning it manages the flow and calls user-defined code at appropriate times. The TodoMVC app serves as a practical test of the framework’s capabilities, mimicking the functionality of the official TodoMVC example. The project emphasizes learning about web development, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, routing, state management, event handling, and documentation.

### Team Division for a Team of 4

To efficiently complete the project, the workload is divided among four team members, each focusing on specific components while collaborating on integration and testing. Below is the division of responsibilities, ensuring balanced workloads and clear roles. The project is split into the framework’s core features, the TodoMVC implementation, and documentation, with shared responsibilities for integration and testing.

#### Team Member 1: DOM Abstraction & Documentation
**Responsibilities:**
- **DOM Abstraction (40% effort):**
  - Design and implement a system to abstract DOM manipulation.
  - Choose a method (e.g., Virtual DOM, Data Binding, or Templating) to handle DOM updates efficiently.
  - Support creating elements, nesting elements, adding attributes, and updating the DOM in response to state changes.
  - Ensure the system accounts for events, children, and attributes, as specified.
  - Example: Create a method to convert a JavaScript object (like the provided HTML structure) into DOM nodes and update only changed parts.
- **Documentation for DOM Abstraction (30% effort):**
  - Write clear, detailed documentation in a markdown file explaining how DOM abstraction works.
  - Provide code examples for:
    - Creating an element (e.g., a `div`).
    - Nesting elements (e.g., a `div` containing an `input`).
    - Adding attributes (e.g., `class`, `type`, `placeholder`).
  - Explain the chosen DOM manipulation method (e.g., why Virtual DOM was used) and how it responds to user actions.
- **Collaboration (30% effort):**
  - Work with Team Member 3 to integrate DOM abstraction with state management (e.g., updating the DOM when state changes).
  - Collaborate with Team Member 4 to ensure DOM abstraction supports TodoMVC rendering.
  - Participate in integration, testing, and folder structure setup.

**Deliverables:**
- JavaScript module(s) for DOM abstraction.
- Markdown documentation section for DOM abstraction.
- Contribution to the TodoMVC app’s rendering logic.

#### Team Member 2: Routing System & Event Handling
**Responsibilities:**
- **Routing System (40% effort):**
  - Develop a routing system to synchronize the app’s state with the URL.
  - Implement a mechanism to update the URL based on user actions (e.g., navigating to `/active` or `/completed` in TodoMVC).
  - Ensure routing triggers appropriate view updates without full page reloads.
  - Example: Use the History API (`pushState`, `popState`) to manage URL changes and map routes to specific views.
- **Event Handling (30% effort):**
  - Create a custom event handling system (not using `addEventListener` directly).
  - Support common events like clicks, keypresses, and scrolling.
  - Provide a simple API for users to attach event handlers to elements.
  - Example: A method like `framework.on('click', element, callback)` to handle events.
- **Documentation for Routing and Events (20% effort):**
  - Document the routing system, explaining how to define routes and how URL changes affect the app.
  - Document the event handling system with examples, e.g., how to add a click event to a button.
  - Explain why the custom event system was designed this way (e.g., to centralize event management).
- **Collaboration (10% effort):**
  - Work with Team Member 3 to ensure routing updates the state correctly.
  - Collaborate with Team Member 4 to handle events in the TodoMVC app (e.g., clicking to toggle a todo).
  - Assist in testing and integration.

**Deliverables:**
- JavaScript module(s) for routing and event handling.
- Markdown documentation sections for routing and event handling.
- Contribution to TodoMVC’s navigation and event-driven features.

---

#### Team Member 3: State Management & Documentation
**Responsibilities:**
- **State Management (50% effort):**
  - Implement a state management system to track the app’s state (e.g., the list of todos and their properties).
  - Ensure state is globally accessible across different pages/views.
  - Provide methods to update the state and notify subscribers (e.g., DOM or routing) of changes.
  - Example: A centralized store with methods like `setState`, `getState`, and a subscription model for updates.
- **Documentation for State Management (30% effort):**
  - Document how the state management system works, including how to initialize, update, and access state.
  - Provide code examples, e.g., updating a todo’s completion status and retrieving the current state.
  - Explain the design choices (e.g., why a single store was used) and how state interacts with other components.
- **Collaboration (20% effort):**
  - Work with Team Member 1 to ensure state changes trigger DOM updates.
  - Collaborate with Team Member 2 to synchronize state with the routing system.
  - Assist Team Member 4 in using the state for TodoMVC functionality.
  - Participate in integration and testing.

**Deliverables:**
- JavaScript module(s) for state management.
- Markdown documentation section for state management.
- Contribution to TodoMVC’s state-driven features.

#### Team Member 4: TodoMVC Implementation & Project Setup
**Responsibilities:**
- **TodoMVC Implementation (50% effort):**
  - Build the TodoMVC app using the framework’s features (DOM abstraction, routing, state management, event handling).
  - Replicate the official TodoMVC example’s functionality, including:
    - Adding, editing, and deleting todos.
    - Toggling todo completion.
    - Filtering todos (all, active, completed).
    - Clearing completed todos.
    - Persisting todos (e.g., using `localStorage`).
  - Ensure all visual and non-visual elements (IDs, classes) match the example.
- **Project Setup and Folder Structure (20% effort):**
  - Organize the project into a clear folder structure (e.g., `/src/framework`, `/src/app`, `/docs`).
  - Ensure the app can be run from the root directory (e.g., using a simple `index.html` and build script if needed).
  - Set up a basic build process (e.g., using a bundler like Webpack or a simple script) if required.
- **CSS and Styling (10% effort):**
  - Apply CSS to match the TodoMVC example’s appearance (use provided TodoMVC CSS if available).
- **Collaboration (20% effort):**
  - Work with all team members to integrate their components into the TodoMVC app.
  - Lead testing to ensure the app and framework work seamlessly.
  - Assist with documentation by providing feedback on usability.

**Deliverables:**
- Fully functional TodoMVC app built with the framework.
- Organized project folder structure with a runnable app.
- CSS for TodoMVC styling.
- Contribution to testing and integration.

### Collaboration and Integration Plan
- **Weekly Syncs:** Hold regular meetings to discuss progress, resolve integration issues, and ensure components work together.
- **Shared Testing:** All members participate in testing the framework and TodoMVC app to verify functionality (e.g., routing updates views, state triggers DOM changes, events work as expected).
- **Code Reviews:** Each member reviews others’ code to maintain quality and consistency.
- **Documentation Consolidation:** Team Members 1, 2, and 3 combine their documentation sections into a single markdown file, with Team Member 4 reviewing for clarity and usability.
- **Integration Milestones:**
  - Week 1: Complete initial implementations of DOM abstraction, routing, state, and event handling.
  - Week 2: Integrate components and start TodoMVC implementation.
  - Week 3: Finalize TodoMVC, polish documentation, and test thoroughly.

---

### Estimated Timeline
Assuming a 3-week project:
- **Week 1:** Develop framework components (DOM, routing, state, events) and draft documentation.
- **Week 2:** Integrate framework components, start TodoMVC, and refine documentation.
- **Week 3:** Complete TodoMVC, finalize documentation, test, and package the project.

---

### Key Considerations
- **No External Frameworks:** Ensure the framework is built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript.
- **Clear Documentation:** Write documentation assuming the user has minimal prior knowledge.
- **TodoMVC Fidelity:** The app must closely match the official example in functionality and appearance.
- **Folder Structure:** Keep it intuitive (e.g., separate framework and app code, include a `README` for setup instructions).
- **Testing:** Test edge cases (e.g., empty todo list, rapid state changes, invalid routes).

This division ensures each team member has a clear focus while fostering collaboration to deliver a cohesive framework and TodoMVC app.
